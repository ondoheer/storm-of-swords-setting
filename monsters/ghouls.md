# Ghouls

Ghouls are mostly carrion eaters, but if hungry enough they can attack living pray in groups.

A **rot** of ghouls can range from 4-40 and tend to be really agressive.
They are a digger race, can bury themselves on soft ground and move up to 40 cm below ground level at a human walking speed.

### Social

- They tend to live below graveyards and battlefields
- They seem to have some basic communication skills, but it hasn't been proved
- They seem vulnerable, as every other living race, to weapon attacks
- They seem to be impermeable
- The wounds inflicted by ghouls tend to infect to the point of being considered poisoned
