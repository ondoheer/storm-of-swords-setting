# Gnolls

Gnolls are a social group, and an advanced enough race to be considered as such. It's just their appetite for the other races meet that has stopped this from happening.

### Social

- They tend to live on cavern systems or small caves
- They can learn the common language
- They seem vulnerable, as every other living race, to weapon attacks
- Their skin is tougher and acts as a natural armor
- They can craft stone, and wood, and learn pretty quickly to use the weapons of other races.
- It's not unheard of a group of hungry Gnolls attacking a small human hamlet or village, but this happens rarely enough for it to be considered _something that needs to be taken care of_
