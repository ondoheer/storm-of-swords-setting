# Goblins

Goblins are the main underground race on the continent. It always baffles the scholars how such a chaotic race can generate such complex social systems.

- There seem to be goblin _territories, kingdoms or groups_ that identify themselves with banners and symbols.
- Underground dwarves are usually in conflict with them and their wars tend to be kept out of the knowledge of the other races.
- A _mob_ of goblins can vary from 12 to the thousands and has a chaotic but differentiated leadership organization
- They can see in the dark and have a hard time moving in the daylight
