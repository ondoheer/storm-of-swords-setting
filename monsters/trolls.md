# Trolls

Trolls are one of the most feared races in the woods.
Humans demonize them as ferocious flesh eating creatures that work for the elves.

The truth is whenever humans encounter them, someone dies.

- It seems trolls have some basic communication skills
- They can forge rudimentary stone weapons and tools
- They don't know how to control fire but value it for cooking. This seems to be the main reason they attack human camps, the rumor says exhausting the fire can be of more help than a hundred warriors
