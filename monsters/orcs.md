# Orcs

Orcs are considered a fairy tale. Humans don't usually have contact with them. Orcs live in small clans 20-65 in the mountains and since the Crusade compete with the other races for room in the extreme corners of the world.

No one knows why they are not considered an elder race, but as the saying goes _"If the elves fought them they are bad"_

- Orcs know how to forge metals
- Seem to have some rudimentary shamanistic powers
- Try to keep to themselves
- According to legends they are know to be able to breed with humans
