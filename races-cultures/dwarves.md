# Dwarves

- **Lifespan**: 140 years
- **Adulthood**: 30years

The Dwarves are quite Tokienish archetypical.
They are a hybrid race that lives underground but can easily adapt to the surface.

Master craftsmen they can carve a bit of magic into objects by the use of runes. Since the bane on magic, this is frowned upon and the most cunning have found a way to cover their magic by using religious "runes".

The dwarves weren't exterminated or enslaved as the other elder races because a large group of them decided to join the humans side on the crusade.

They have split into many factions but can be summarized in two

1. **The Sold Outs**: The dwarves that live among the humans, joined the Crusade and fought the elder races.
2. **The True Dwarves**: Still live in some cavern halls and plan/plot to take revenge on their traitor kin.

_It is impossible to distinguish them physically._
