# Draughur

- **Lifespan**: Unknown
- **Adulthood**: Unknown

The Draughur are an extint ancien race.
They were more technologically advanced than the rest of races, harnessing what they called the **power of the earth** in their magic crystals to develop energy based technology.

The elves are the only ones who have a theory of where they came from and how they disappeared.

## Technology

Their technology is a myth, none have seen it and the stories talk even about levitating platforms, force shields, and weather control systems.

The elves blame them for the seed
