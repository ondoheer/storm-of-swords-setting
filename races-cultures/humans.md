# Humans

- **Lifespan**: 85 years

Humans are called the _strangers, intruders or invaders_ by the elder races.
They evolved later and it is believed they arrived by a frozen path that self generated during a small ice age a few hundred years ago.

The elder races respected them and gave them shelter, believed the continent was large enough for all of them and mostly ignored them except to trade with them.

In the centuries before [The Great War]() the humans developed complex social systems and competed against each other for the resources and technological advancements. This led to many smaller conflicts and the development of social identities.

From this social evolution 3 small Empires appeared.

1. [Lemia]()
1. [Kiver]()
1. [Noth]()

Even though most human cultures are similar, these three were established on specific religious and commercial interests.

Humans have evolved resentful and distrusting of everything that seems to be different. This has defined them as a culture.
