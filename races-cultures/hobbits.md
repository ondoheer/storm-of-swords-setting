**EXTINT**

Hobbits lived as peaceful farmers and hunters near rivers. They integrated quickly with the humans as that symbiosis helped them defend from the monster races.

Sadly, the human fervour against the elder races was tested on them. Called an aberration of chaos, they were slaughtered, burned and dilapidated and their extensive farm fields expropriated by the human kingdoms
