# Elves

elder

There seem to be at least 2 kind of elves, although it's not clear wether they are different races or just from different social groups.

### Aiea Dnoie

Known by humans as higher elves.
They are taller, more _refined_ and seem to be the nobility of the elven people. Most elven slaves are of this kind.

### Igea Dnoie

Known by humans as lower elves.
Taller than a human but rougher on their appearance. Humans think they are les evolved and live only in the woods. They are more commonly found in the guerrilla groups that attack human caravans and frontiers from time to time.

## Magic

The elves have control of the forces they call **ElÃ«a** which they use to conjure all kinds of arts and crafts. Humans have never gained access to this forces and this is the main reason they distrust the elder races.
